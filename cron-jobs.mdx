## Overview

A1Base's Cron Jobs feature allows you to set up automated tasks that run on a defined schedule. This is particularly useful for:

- Daily check-ins with your users
- Scheduled data updates
- Periodic notifications
- Automated reporting
- Triggering AI agent workflows at specific times

Cron jobs make HTTP requests to your specified endpoints, allowing you to integrate with any system that accepts webhook calls.

## Creating a Cron Job

2. Click on "Create New Cron Job" to open the creation form.  
3. Fill out the fields on the "Create Cron Job" page:

   - **Endpoint URL**: Enter the publicly accessible URL that will receive the HTTP request (e.g., https://api.example.com/webhook).  
   - **Frequency**: Choose how often your cron job should run (e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly, or Custom).  
   - **Time**: Select the specific time of day when your cron job should run.  
   - **Timezone**: Choose your preferred timezone so the job runs at the correct local time.

## Example Cron Job Configurations

Here are some practical examples of how to configure cron jobs for different AI agent applications:

### Example 1: Daily Customer Check-in Bot

**Use Case**: Send a morning check-in message to all users asking about their day.

**Configuration**:
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-api.example.com/send-daily-checkin`
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Time**: 09:00 AM
- **Timezone**: America/New_York
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  ```
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Good morning! How are you feeling today?",
    "include_name": true
  }
  ```

This cron job will automatically trigger your customer engagement system to send personalized check-in messages to all active users every morning at 9 AM Eastern Time.

### Example 2: Weekly Analytics Report

**Use Case**: Generate and send a weekly performance report to business stakeholders

**Configuration**:
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-api.example.com/generate-weekly-report`
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Day**: Monday
- **Time**: 06:00 AM
- **Timezone**: America/Los_Angeles
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
  ```
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "report_type": "weekly_summary",
    "metrics": ["user_engagement", "conversion_rate", "response_time"],
    "format": "pdf",
    "recipients": ["team@example.com", "executives@example.com"]
  }
  ```

This cron job runs every Monday morning at 6 AM Pacific Time, generating comprehensive analytics reports and automatically distributing them to relevant team members before the work week begins.

### Example 3: Monthly Subscription Renewal Reminder

**Use Case**: Send reminders to users whose subscriptions are about to expire

**Configuration**:
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-api.example.com/subscription-reminders`
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Day**: 25
- **Time**: 10:00 AM
- **Timezone**: UTC
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Headers**:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
