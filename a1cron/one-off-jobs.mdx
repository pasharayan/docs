# One-Off Cron Jobs

Sometimes you need to schedule a task to run just once at a specific time in the future. While A1Cron is primarily designed for recurring schedules, you can achieve one-off execution using a simple workaround with our existing scheduling options.

<Note>
This is a temporary workaround. We're developing enhanced features that will allow AI agents and applications to dynamically schedule one-time tasks more elegantly. Stay tuned for updates!
</Note>

## Why One-Off Jobs?

One-off cron jobs are useful for:
- **Scheduled reminders**: Send a reminder email at a specific future time
- **Delayed processing**: Process data after a waiting period
- **Time-sensitive operations**: Execute tasks at precise moments
- **Event-driven scheduling**: Schedule follow-ups based on user actions
- **AI agent tasks**: Allow AI systems to schedule future actions dynamically

## Method 1: Using End Occurrences

The cleanest approach is to create a cron job that ends after exactly one execution.

### How It Works

Set `end_type` to `"after"` and `end_occurrences` to `1`. The job will:
1. Wait until the scheduled time
2. Execute once
3. Automatically deactivate

### Example: Schedule a Task for Tomorrow at 2:30 PM

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.a1base.com/v1/cron-jobs/{accountId}/create \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "X-API-Secret: your-api-secret" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Send Follow-up Email",
    "description": "One-time follow-up email to customer",
    "endpoint_url": "https://api.example.com/send-followup",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": "{\"customer_id\": \"12345\", \"template\": \"followup_24h\"}",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "schedule_config": {
      "repeat_type": "days",
      "repeat_every": 1,
      "time": "14:30",
      "end_type": "after",
      "end_occurrences": 1
    },
    "tags": ["one-off", "followup", "customer-12345"],
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

```javascript Node.js
const scheduleOneOffTask = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.a1base.com/v1/cron-jobs/{accountId}/create',
    {
      name: "Send Follow-up Email",
      description: "One-time follow-up email to customer",
      endpoint_url: "https://api.example.com/send-followup",
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        customer_id: "12345",
        template: "followup_24h"
      }),
      timezone: "America/New_York",
      schedule_config: {
        repeat_type: "days",
        repeat_every: 1,
        time: "14:30",
        end_type: "after",
        end_occurrences: 1
      },
      tags: ["one-off", "followup", "customer-12345"],
      is_active: true
    },
    {
      headers: {
        'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key',
        'X-API-Secret': 'your-api-secret'
      }
    }
  );
  
  console.log(`One-off task scheduled for: ${response.data.next_run_at}`);
};
```

```python Python
import requests
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def schedule_one_off_task():
    # Calculate tomorrow's date
    tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
    
    data = {
        "name": "Send Follow-up Email",
        "description": "One-time follow-up email to customer",
        "endpoint_url": "https://api.example.com/send-followup",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": json.dumps({
            "customer_id": "12345",
            "template": "followup_24h"
        }),
        "timezone": "America/New_York",
        "schedule_config": {
            "repeat_type": "days",
            "repeat_every": 1,
            "time": "14:30",
            "end_type": "after",
            "end_occurrences": 1
        },
        "tags": ["one-off", "followup", "customer-12345"],
        "is_active": True
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.a1base.com/v1/cron-jobs/{accountId}/create",
        headers={
            "X-API-Key": "your-api-key",
            "X-API-Secret": "your-api-secret"
        },
        json=data
    )
    
    if response.status_code == 201:
        next_run = response.json()['data']['next_run_at']
        print(f"One-off task scheduled for: {next_run}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Method 2: Using End Date

Alternatively, set an end date shortly after the desired execution time.

### How It Works

Set `end_type` to `"on"` with an `end_date` just after your target time. This ensures:
1. The job runs at the scheduled time
2. The schedule expires immediately after

### Example: Schedule for a Specific Date and Time

```json
{
  "name": "Holiday Sale Announcement",
  "description": "Send holiday sale email on Dec 25 at 9 AM",
  "endpoint_url": "https://api.example.com/send-announcement",
  "method": "POST",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "schedule_config": {
    "repeat_type": "days",
    "repeat_every": 1,
    "time": "09:00",
    "end_type": "on",
    "end_date": "2024-12-25T09:01:00-05:00"
  },
  "tags": ["one-off", "holiday", "announcement"]
}
```

<Warning>
When using the end date method, ensure the end_date is at least 1 minute after your scheduled time to account for any execution delays.
</Warning>

## Practical Examples

### 1. Delayed Task Execution

Schedule a task to run in 2 hours:

```javascript
const scheduleDelayedTask = async (delayHours = 2) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const runTime = new Date(now.getTime() + (delayHours * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  const timeStr = `${runTime.getHours().toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${runTime.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
  
  const response = await createCronJob({
    name: `Delayed Task - ${now.toISOString()}`,
    endpoint_url: "https://api.example.com/process-delayed",
    schedule_config: {
      repeat_type: "days",
      repeat_every: 1,
      time: timeStr,
      end_type: "after",
      end_occurrences: 1
    }
  });
  
  return response.data;
};
```

### 2. AI Agent Scheduling

Allow an AI agent to schedule a follow-up action:

```python
def ai_schedule_followup(user_id, action, delay_minutes):
    """
    AI agent schedules a one-time follow-up action
    """
    run_time = datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=delay_minutes)
    time_str = run_time.strftime("%H:%M")
    
    cron_data = {
        "name": f"AI Follow-up: {action}",
        "description": f"AI-scheduled task for user {user_id}",
        "endpoint_url": "https://api.example.com/ai/execute-action",
        "method": "POST",
        "body": json.dumps({
            "user_id": user_id,
            "action": action,
            "scheduled_by": "ai_agent"
        }),
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "schedule_config": {
            "repeat_type": "days",
            "repeat_every": 1,
            "time": time_str,
            "end_type": "after",
            "end_occurrences": 1
        },
        "callbacks": {
            "success_url": "https://api.example.com/ai/action-completed",
            "failure_url": "https://api.example.com/ai/action-failed"
        },
        "tags": ["ai-scheduled", "one-off", f"user-{user_id}"]
    }
    
    # Create the one-off cron job
    return create_cron_job(cron_data)
```

### 3. Event-Driven Scheduling

Schedule a task based on user events:

```javascript
// When user signs up, schedule a welcome email for 24 hours later
app.post('/user/signup', async (req, res) => {
  const { userId, email } = req.body;
  
  // Create user account
  await createUser({ userId, email });
  
  // Schedule welcome follow-up for tomorrow
  const tomorrow = new Date();
  tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);
  const timeStr = "10:00"; // 10 AM in user's timezone
  
  await scheduleOneOffCron({
    name: `Welcome Email - ${userId}`,
    endpoint_url: "https://api.example.com/emails/send-welcome",
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ userId, email }),
    timezone: getUserTimezone(userId),
    schedule_config: {
      repeat_type: "days",
      repeat_every: 1,
      time: timeStr,
      end_type: "after",
      end_occurrences: 1
    },
    tags: ["welcome", "one-off", `user-${userId}`]
  });
  
  res.json({ message: "User created and welcome email scheduled" });
});
```

## Best Practices for One-Off Jobs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names">
    Include timestamps or unique identifiers in job names to distinguish one-off tasks:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Follow-up Email - User 12345 - 2024-01-25"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Tag Appropriately">
    Use tags to identify and manage one-off jobs:
    ```json
    {
      "tags": ["one-off", "temporary", "user-12345", "2024-01-25"]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clean Up After Execution">
    Consider deleting completed one-off jobs to keep your job list clean:
    ```javascript
    // In your success webhook handler
    app.post('/webhooks/cron-success', async (req, res) => {
      const { cron_job_id, cron_job_name } = req.body;
      
      if (cron_job_name.includes('one-off')) {
        // Delete the completed one-off job
        await deleteCronJob(cron_job_id);
      }
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Execution">
    Set up webhook callbacks to confirm one-off tasks complete successfully:
    ```json
    {
      "callbacks": {
        "success_url": "https://api.example.com/one-off-completed",
        "failure_url": "https://api.example.com/one-off-failed"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Minimum Scheduling Time**: Jobs can only be scheduled for future times, not immediate execution
2. **Timezone Awareness**: Ensure you're using the correct timezone for your one-off execution
3. **No Second Precision**: Cron jobs run at minute precision (HH:MM), not exact seconds
4. **Cleanup Required**: One-off jobs remain in your job list after execution unless manually deleted

## Future Improvements

<Info>
We're actively developing enhanced features for one-off scheduling:

- **Native one-off job type**: Direct support without workarounds
- **Dynamic scheduling API**: Allow AI agents to schedule tasks programmatically
- **Immediate execution**: Option to run tasks with minimal delay
- **Batch one-off scheduling**: Create multiple one-off tasks in a single request
- **Auto-cleanup**: Automatic removal of completed one-off jobs

These improvements will make A1Cron even more powerful for AI agents and dynamic applications.
</Info>

## Summary

While A1Cron is designed for recurring schedules, you can effectively create one-off jobs using:
1. **End occurrences method**: Set `end_occurrences: 1` for clean one-time execution
2. **End date method**: Set an end date shortly after the scheduled time

Both methods work reliably for scheduling tasks that need to run exactly once at a future time. Choose the method that best fits your use case and remember to tag your one-off jobs appropriately for easy management.

For immediate task execution, consider using the [manual trigger](/a1cron/trigger) feature instead of scheduling a one-off job.
