### Sending Group Messages:

* The agent's phone number must first be added to the group chat before messages can be sent.

* You'll need the thread\_id of the group chat to send messages. This is provided when you create a group or in webhook events.

### Example Request

#### Text Message to Group

```json
POST /group/{accountId}/send
Headers:
  x-api-key: your_api_key
  x-api-secret: your_api_secret
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "from": "+14155552671",
  "thread_id": "group-thread-id-123",
  "service": "whatsapp",
  "message": "Hello everyone in the group!"
}
```

#### Media Message to Group
To send a document to a group:

```json
POST /group/{accountId}/send
Headers:
  x-api-key: your_api_key
  x-api-secret: your_api_secret
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "from": "+14155552671",
  "thread_id": "group-thread-id-123",
  "service": "whatsapp",
  "message_type": "media",
  "media_url": "https://example.com/documents/report.pdf",
  "media_type": "document",
  "caption": "Here's the quarterly report"
}
```

### Using the Universal Endpoint for Groups
You can also use the newer universal endpoint for group messages:

```json
POST /send/{accountId}
Headers:
  x-api-key: your_api_key
  x-api-secret: your_api_secret
  Content-Type: application/json

Body:
{
  "from": "+14155552671",
  "thread_id": "group-thread-id-123",
  "service": "whatsapp",
  "type": "group",
  "content": {
    "type": "media",
    "media_url": "https://example.com/videos/demo.mp4",
    "media_type": "video",
    "caption": "Product demo video for the team"
  }
}
```

### Important Notes for Group Media Messages
* For group messages, you need a valid `thread_id` instead of a `to` number.
* The `caption` field is optional. You can send media without a caption if desired.
* The same media type and size restrictions apply as with individual messages:
  * Images: Generally up to 5MB
  * Videos: Generally up to 16MB
  * Audio: Generally up to 16MB
  * Documents: Generally up to 100MB
* The agent must be a member of the group before sending messages.
