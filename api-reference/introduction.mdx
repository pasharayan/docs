<Note>
  As we're in Alpha right now, you can only get your API key by contacting the founders at pasha@a1base.com or pennie@a1base.com
</Note>

## Welcome
The A1Base API allows you to give your AI Agent a phone number and send messages on WhatsApp and Telegram.

## Authentication
All requests to the A1Base API must include two headers:

- `X-API-Key`: Your API key
- `X-API-Secret`: Your API secret

If you are using our official SDKs, you will set these credentials when constructing a client, and the SDK will automatically include them with every request. If you're integrating directly with the API, you'll need to include these headers yourself.

As A1Base is in Alpha your keys will be provided to you by the team after an onboarding call.
