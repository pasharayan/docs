# Receiving Emails

A1Base can forward incoming emails to your application via webhooks. When an email is received at your A1Base email address, we'll send a POST request to your configured webhook URL with the email details.
You can configure your webhook on the [email dashboard here](https://www.a1base.com/dashboard/email-addresses)

## Webhook Payload

When an email is received, A1Base will send a POST request to your webhook endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
    "email_id": "a82b3e6b-dc79-46ad-9284-a166629592e3",
    "subject": "Email Subject",
    "sender_address": "sender@example.com",
    "recipient_address": "your-address@a1send.com",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-19T10:24:08.46083+00:00",
    "service": "email",
    "raw_email_data": "Full email content including headers and body"
}
```
