## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to build a simple WhatsApp bot using A1Base that helps track daily accomplishments, similar to a standup meeting. The bot sends daily reminders and collects responses from users.

### Use Cases

A standup coach bot can help with:
- Daily progress tracking
- Team accountability
- Remote team coordination
- Building consistent reflection habits
- Asynchronous status updates

## Implementation

Here's a complete Express.js server implementation that:
1. Sends WhatsApp reminders asking about daily accomplishments
2. Receives and stores responses
3. Manages message handling through A1Base's API
