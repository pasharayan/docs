## Introduction

Creating an AI life coach bot can help provide personalized guidance and support. This guide covers the key components needed to build a basic life coaching agent.

### Use Cases

A life coach bot can assist with:

* Goal setting and tracking

* Daily motivation and accountability

* Basic emotional support

* Habit formation guidance

* Time management suggestions

### Code

```typescript
import { A1BaseAPI, type WhatsAppIncomingData } from "a1base-node";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import express, { Express, Request, Response } from "express";

const AGENT_NUMBER = "YOUR_AGENT_NUMBER"; //e.g. +12345678900
const API_KEY = "YOUR_A1BASE_API_KEY";
const API_SECRET = "YOUR_A1BASE_API_SECRET";
const ACCOUNT_ID = "YOUR_A1BASE_ACCOUNT_ID";

// Initialize A1Base client
const credentials = {
  apiKey: API_KEY,
  apiSecret: API_SECRET,
};
const client = new A1BaseAPI({
  credentials
});

// Life coach questions array
const coachingQuestions = [
  "What's the most important goal you want to achieve this month? üéØ",
  "What's one small step you can take today towards your goal? üë£",
  "What obstacles are currently holding you back? üöß",
  "How can you reframe those challenges into opportunities? üîÑ",
  "What are you grateful for today? üôè",
  "What's one thing you can do to take better care of yourself? üíù",
  "Who can support you in achieving your goals? ü§ù",
  "What would make today a win for you? üèÜ",
  "What limiting beliefs do you need to let go of? ü¶ã",
  "What's one positive habit you'd like to develop? ‚ú®",
];

  threadMessages.push(message);
  messagesByThread.set(threadId, threadMessages);
