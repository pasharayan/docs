### Use Cases

A life coach bot can assist with:

* Goal setting and tracking

* Daily motivation and accountability

* Basic emotional support

* Habit formation guidance

* Time management suggestions

### Code

```javascript
import express from "express";
import fetch from "node-fetch";
const app = express();
const port = 3334;

// Life coach questions array
const coachingQuestions = [
  "What's the most important goal you want to achieve this month? 🎯",
  "What's one small step you can take today towards your goal? 👣",
  "What obstacles are currently holding you back? 🚧",
  "How can you reframe those challenges into opportunities? 🔄",
  "What are you grateful for today? 🙏",
  "What's one thing you can do to take better care of yourself? 💝",
  "Who can support you in achieving your goals? 🤝",
  "What would make today a win for you? 🏆",
  "What limiting beliefs do you need to let go of? 🦋",
  "What's one positive habit you'd like to develop? ✨"
];

// Environment variables for API keys
const API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY;
const API_SECRET = YOUR_API_SECRET;
const ACCOUNT_ID = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID;
const FROM_NUMBER = YOUR_FROM_NUMBER; // e.g +61400111222

// Middleware to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Store for received messages and user states
let receivedMessages = [];
let userStates = new Map(); // Tracks which question each user is on

// Helper function to send WhatsApp message
async function sendWhatsAppMessage(to, content) {
  console.log(`[WhatsApp] Sending message to ${to}:`, content);
  const options = {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X-API-Key": API_KEY,
      "X-API-Secret": API_SECRET,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      content,
      from: FROM_NUMBER,
      to,
      service: "whatsapp",
    }),
  };

  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://api.a1base.com/v1/messages/individual/${ACCOUNT_ID}/send`,
      options
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text();
      throw new Error(`API request failed: ${errorText}`);
    }

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log("[WhatsApp] Message sent successfully:", result);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[WhatsApp] Error sending message:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Function to get next question for user
function getNextQuestion(phoneNumber) {
  const currentIndex = userStates.get(phoneNumber) || 0;
  const question = coachingQuestions[currentIndex];
  
  // Update user's state to next question
  userStates.set(phoneNumber, (currentIndex + 1) % coachingQuestions.length);
  
  return question;
}

// Endpoint to start coaching session
app.post("/start-coaching", async (req, res) => {
  console.log("[Coaching] Received request:", req.body);
  const { phoneNumber } = req.body;

  if (!phoneNumber) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Phone number is required" });
  }

  try {
    const welcomeMessage = "Welcome to your personal life coaching session! 🌟 Let's begin our journey together.";
    await sendWhatsAppMessage(phoneNumber, welcomeMessage);
    
    // Send first question after welcome message
    const firstQuestion = getNextQuestion(phoneNumber);
    const response = await sendWhatsAppMessage(phoneNumber, firstQuestion);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      messageId: response.messageId
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Failed to start coaching session" });
  }
});

// Endpoint to receive WhatsApp replies
app.post("/receive-message", async (req, res) => {
  console.log("[Receive] Incoming message:", req.body);
  const { from, content, timestamp } = req.body;

  if (!from || !content) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "From and content are required" });
  }

  const message = {
    from,
    content,
    timestamp: timestamp || new Date().toISOString()
  };

  receivedMessages.push(message);
  console.log("[Receive] Stored new message:", message);

  // Send next question after receiving response
  try {
    const nextQuestion = getNextQuestion(from);
    await sendWhatsAppMessage(from, nextQuestion);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("[Coaching] Error sending next question:", error);
  }
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`[Server] Life Coach bot running at http://localhost:${port}`);
  if (!API_KEY || !API_SECRET || !ACCOUNT_ID || !FROM_NUMBER) {
    console.warn("[Server] Warning: Missing environment variables for WhatsApp integration");
  }
});
