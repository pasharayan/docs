## Setup your initial environment

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### 1. Install the A1Base CLI or webhook

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API keys">
    To start using A1Base you need an API key and secret. You can get these by
    booking an onboarding call at https://cal.com/team/a1base/a1base-book-a-demo or
    contacting the founders at pasha@a1base.com or pennie@a1base.com.

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Set up your key variables">

    const API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY; 
    const API_SECRET = YOUR_API_SECRET;
    const ACCOUNT_ID = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID;

```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
