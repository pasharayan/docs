## 1. Sign Up and Get API Keys

<Card title="Create an Account" icon="user-plus">
  Sign up at [A1Base Dashboard](https://www.a1base.com/) and get your API credentials.
</Card>

- Keep these credentials secure as they'll be used for all API requests

## 2. Create an Email Address

You have two options to create your A1Mail email address:

  <Card title="Dashboard Method" icon="browser">
      <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.a1base.com/dashboard/email-addresses">Email Dashboard</a></li>

      <li>Click "Create New Email Address"</li>

      <li>Enter your desired email name (e.g., "hello")</li>

      <li>Select the domain (@a1send.com)</li>

      <li>Click "Create"</li>
  </Card>

  <Card title="API Method" icon="code">
    Use the API to programmatically create an email address:
    

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.a1base.com/v1/emails/{account_id}/create-email' \
    --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
    --header 'X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "address": "hello",
        "domain_name": "a1send.com"
    }'
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
Note: Email addresses must be between 5 and 30 characters long.

## 3. Test Your New Inbox - Set Up Webhook for Receiving Emails

### Overview
To receive incoming emails, you'll need to configure a webhook that will notify your application when new emails arrive. This section guides you through setting up and testing webhooks in your development environment.

### 3.1. Create a Webhook Endpoint
First, create an endpoint in your application to receive email notifications. You can use one of our example snippets below or create your own.

<Card title="Webhook Implementation Examples" icon="webhook">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python (Flask)">
      ```python
      from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
      
      app = Flask(__name__)
      
      @app.route('/webhook/email', methods=['POST'])
      def email_webhook():
          # Get the webhook payload
          data = request.json        
          
          # Process the incoming email
          print(f"Received email: {data['subject']} from {data['sender_address']}")
          
          # Access specific parts of the email
          email_id = data.get('email_id')
          subject = data.get('subject')
          sender = data.get('sender_address')
          recipient = data.get('recipient_address')
          timestamp = data.get('timestamp')
          raw_email = data.get('raw_email_data')
          
          # Your logic here
          # ...
          
          # Return a success response
          return jsonify({"status": "success"}), 200

      app.post('/webhook/email', (req, res) => {
        // Get the webhook payload
        const data = req.body;      
        
        // Process the incoming email
        console.log(`Received email: ${data.subject} from ${data.sender_address}`);        
        
        // Access specific parts of the email
        const emailId = data.email_id;
        const subject = data.subject;
        const sender = data.sender_address;
        const recipient = data.recipient_address;
        const timestamp = data.timestamp;
        const rawEmail = data.raw_email_data;
        
        // Your logic here
        // ...
        
        // Return a success response
        res.status(200).json({ status: 'success' });
      });
      
      app.listen(3000, () => {

    <Tab title="JavaScript (Vanilla)">
      ```javascript
      // Simple vanilla JavaScript webhook handler
      // Can be used with any JavaScript framework or serverless function
      
      async function handleEmailWebhook(request) {
        try {
          // Parse the incoming JSON payload
          const data = await request.json();
          
          console.log(`Received email: ${data.subject} from ${data.sender_address}`);

            sender_address, 
            recipient_address, 
            timestamp, 
            service,
            raw_email_data 
          } = data;
          
          // Your logic here
          // ...

            status: 200,
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
          });
        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error processing webhook:', error);
          return new Response(JSON.stringify({ status: 'error', message: error.message }), {
            status: 500,
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
          });
        }
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

### 3.2 Expose Your Local Webhook Endpoint

To receive emails in your inbox, you need to expose your local webhook endpoint to the internet. You can use ngrok to do this.
Run the following command in your CLI to start ngrok:  
```bash  
ngrok http 3000
```
After starting ngrok

1. **Find the forwarding URL** in the ngrok output:
    ```
    Forwarding https://0fcbcda91e79.ngrok.app -> http://localhost:3000
    ```

2. **Create the full webhook URL** by appending your webhook endpoint path:
    ```
    https://0fcbcda91e79.ngrok.app/webhook/email
    ```

3. **Use this complete URL** in the A1Mail dashboard webhook settings.


### 3.3 Register Your Webhook in the Dashboard

Once you have your webhook URL, you need to register it in the A1Mail dashboard:

1. Log in to your [A1Base Dashboard](https://www.a1base.com/)
2. Navigate to the Email Settings section
3. Find your email address and click "Configure Webhook"
4. Enter your full webhook URL (e.g., `https://0fcbcda91e79.ngrok.app/webhook/email`)
5. Click "Save Changes"

### 3.4 Test Your Webhook

Send a test email to your inbox and check if the webhook is receiving the email notifications.

## 4. Send Your First Email

Now that you've confirmed your inbox can receive emails, you can start sending emails as that email address.


<Card title="Sending an Email via API" icon="paper-plane">
  Use the following API call to send your first email:
  
  ```bash
  curl --location 'https://api.a1base.com/v1/emails/{account_id}/send' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'X-API-Secret: YOUR_API_SECRET' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "from": "hello@a1send.com",
      "to": "recipient@example.com",
      "subject": "My First A1Mail Email",
      "text": "Hello from my AI agent! This is my first email sent through A1Mail."
  }'
  ```
</Card>

## 5. In Summary

To ensure everything is working correctly:

1. Send a test email to your new A1Mail address from your personal email
2. Check that your webhook receives the incoming email notification
3. Respond to the email using the A1Mail API

Now that you've set up basic email functionality, explore more advanced features:

- [Sending HTML Emails](/a1mail/sending-email)
- [Setting Up Custom Mail Domains](/a1mail/custom-mail-domain/index)
- [Email Webhook Security](/api-reference/email/receiving-email)

With these steps completed, your AI agent now has a fully functional email inbox! You can send and receive emails programmatically, enabling your agent to communicate with users through email.
