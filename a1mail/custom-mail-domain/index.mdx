# **Test your DNS Settings**

After setting up your DNS records, it's essential to verify that they are properly configured. Here's how:

#### 1. Check your DNS records

- Use a DNS lookup tool (e.g., [MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/)) to verify your DNS records
- Check that your MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are correctly set up
- For detailed instructions, follow our [How to Verify your DNS Settings](verify-dns-settings) guide

#### 2. Test email delivery

- Send an email to your new custom domain address. By default, all new mail domains will have a `postmaster@yourdomain.com` inbox
- If the email is delivered successfully, you can move on to the next step

#### Running into issues?

> Feel free to reach out to [founders@a1base.com](mailto:founders@a1base.com) directly if you run into any issues during the setup process.

# **Warm up your new mail domain**

After setting up your custom mail domain, you'll need to properly warm it up to ensure good deliverability. Here's how:

#### 1. Create a new email with your subdomain

- Create an email address using your new subdomain (e.g., `hello@mail.example.com`)
- Follow our [Creating Email Addresses guide](api-reference/email/create-email) for detailed instructions

#### 2. Send some test emails to your new address

- Send emails from your personal accounts (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to your new address

> üí° **Warming up tips**: New email domains need time to build reputation. Start with low volumes (5-10 emails/day) for the first week, then gradually increase. Avoid sending mass emails immediately after setup.

#### 3. Receiving emails

- Check that incoming emails are properly delivered to your new address
- For more details on receiving and managing emails, see our [Receiving Emails guide](api-reference/email/receiving-email)

#### 4. Send emails using the A1Base API

- Once your domain is properly warmed up, start sending emails programmatically
- Use the A1Base API to send emails from your custom domain address
- Follow our [Sending Emails guide](api-reference/email/sending-email) for implementation details

Note:
- Engage with these emails by replying to them
- This helps establish a positive sending reputation for your domain
