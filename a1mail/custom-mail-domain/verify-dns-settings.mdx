## Why DNS Verification Is Important

Correctly configured DNS records are essential for:
- **Email delivery**: Ensures your emails reach their destination
- **Sender reputation**: Helps prevent your emails from being marked as spam
- **Security**: Protects your domain from email spoofing and phishing attacks

## What Records to Verify

Before using any verification tools, understand what you're looking for:

### 1. MX Records

Verify that your MX record points to `mail.a101.bot` with priority `10`:

```
yourdomain.com. IN MX 10 mail.a101.bot.
```

### 2. SPF Records

Verify your SPF record is correctly formatted and includes the A1Mail server:

```
mail.yourdomain.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:110.232.112.135 a:mail.a101.bot ~all"
```

### 3. DKIM Records

Verify your DKIM record exists and contains the public key provided by A1Mail:

```
2025_default_mail._domainkey.mail.yourdomain.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; t=y; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA..."
```

### 4. DMARC Records

Verify your DMARC record is correctly formatted:

```
_dmarc.yourdomain.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@yourdomain.com"
```

dig TXT mail.yourdomain.com
dig TXT _dmarc.yourdomain.com
dig TXT 2025_default_mail._domainkey.mail.yourdomain.com
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### DNS Propagation Delays

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate worldwide. If your verification fails initially, wait a few hours and try again.

### Incorrect Record Format

Ensure there are no typos or formatting errors in your DNS records. Even small errors can cause verification to fail.

### Missing Records

Verify that all required records (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC) are present. Missing any one of these can affect email deliverability.

### Cloudflare Proxy Enabled

If using Cloudflare, ensure the proxy (orange cloud) is disabled for all email-related DNS records. Email requires direct DNS resolution.
