## Common Webhook Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Webhook not receiving messages">
    ### Webhook Not Receiving Messages
    
    If your webhook isn't receiving expected messages, check the following:
    
    1. **Verify the webhook URL** in your A1Base dashboard is correct and publicly accessible. 
    2. **Use the right URL route** - sometimes people forget to add the specific route of the website (e.g. /apu/receive-message)
    2. **Check your server logs** for any incoming requests that might be failing
    3. **Ensure your server is accepting POST requests** with JSON content
    4. **Confirm your firewall settings** allow incoming webhook requests
    5. **Verify SSL/TLS certificates** if you're using HTTPS (required for production)
    
    **Quick Test:**
    ```bash
    # Test if your endpoint is publicly accessible
    curl -X POST https://your-webhook-url.com/path \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"test":"payload"}'
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Vercel timeout issues">
    ### Vercel Timeout Issues
    
    Vercel has a default function timeout of 10 seconds for hobby plans and 60 seconds for pro plans. If your webhook processing takes longer, you might experience timeouts.
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    1. **Acknowledge webhooks immediately** and process them asynchronously:
    
    ```typescript
    app.post('/whatsapp/incoming', async (req, res) => {
      // Immediately acknowledge receipt to prevent timeout
      res.status(200).json({ success: true });
      
      // Then process the webhook asynchronously
      try {
        await processWebhookAsync(req.body);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing webhook:', error);
      }
    });
    
    async function processWebhookAsync(data) {
      // Your time-consuming processing logic here
    }
    ```
    
    2. **Upgrade to Vercel Pro** for longer function execution times
    
    3. **Use a serverless queue** like AWS SQS or a background job processor
    
    4. **Consider moving webhook processing** to a different hosting provider without strict timeout limits

  <Accordion icon="link" title="Using the right endpoint">
    ### Using the Right Endpoint
    
    Using incorrect webhook endpoints is a common issue that can prevent proper message delivery.
    
    **Best Practices:**
    
    1. **Use dedicated endpoints** for different services (e.g., `/webhooks/a1base` instead of a generic `/webhook`)
    
    2. **Include version information** in your webhook paths (e.g., `/api/v1/webhooks/a1base`)
    
    3. **Verify the correct endpoint format** in the A1Base dashboard:
       - Must be a complete URL including `https://`
       - Must point to a publicly accessible server
       - Should not include query parameters unless necessary
    
    **Example of proper endpoint structure:**
    ```
    https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/a1base
    ```
    
    **Not:**
    ```
    your-domain.com/webhooks
    /api/webhooks
    ```

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Authentication and security issues">
    ### Authentication and Security Issues
    
    Securing your webhook is essential to prevent unauthorized access.
    
    **Security Best Practices:**
    
    1. **Validate webhook signatures** if provided by A1Base
    
    2. **Implement IP whitelisting** if A1Base provides a static IP range
    
    3. **Use a webhook secret** to validate authentic requests:
    
    ```typescript
    import crypto from 'crypto';
    
    app.post('/whatsapp/incoming', (req, res) => {
      const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
      const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
      const secret = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;
      
      const expectedSignature = crypto
        .createHmac('sha256', secret)
        .update(payload)
        .digest('hex');
      
      if (signature !== expectedSignature) {
        return res.status(403).send('Invalid signature');
      }
      
      // Process valid webhook
      res.status(200).send('Success');
    });
    ```
    
    4. **Don't expose sensitive information** in your webhook response
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="network-wired" title="Network and infrastructure problems">
    ### Network and Infrastructure Problems
    
    Network issues can cause intermittent webhook failures.
    
    **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    
    1. **Check your server's connectivity** and ensure it has stable internet access
    
    2. **Monitor server load** as high CPU or memory usage can cause webhook processing delays
    
    3. **Implement retry logic** in your webhook handler:
    
    ```typescript
    async function processWebhookWithRetry(data, maxRetries = 3) {
      let retries = 0;
      
      while (retries < maxRetries) {
        try {
          await processWebhook(data);
          return; // Success
        } catch (error) {
          retries++;
          console.error(`Attempt ${retries} failed:`, error);
          
          if (retries >= maxRetries) {
            console.error('Max retries reached. Giving up.');
            // Consider logging to a monitoring service or error tracker
            break;
          }
          
          // Exponential backoff
          await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000 * Math.pow(2, retries)));
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    4. **Use a monitoring service** like Sentry, New Relic, or Datadog to track webhook reliability

  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Debugging webhook payloads">
    ### Debugging Webhook Payloads
    
    When webhooks arrive but processing fails, payload issues might be the cause.
    
    **Debugging Techniques:**
    
    1. **Log the complete webhook payload** during development:
    
    ```typescript
    app.post('/whatsapp/incoming', (req, res) => {
      console.log('Webhook received:', JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2));
      
      // Implement validation to ensure all required fields are present
      const { thread_id, message_id, message_content } = req.body;
      
      if (!thread_id || !message_id || !message_content) {
        console.error('Missing required fields in webhook payload');
        return res.status(400).send('Invalid payload');
      }
      
      // Process valid webhook
      res.status(200).send('Success');
    });
    ```
    
    2. **Implement schema validation** using libraries like Joi or Zod
    
    3. **Create a webhook simulator** for testing your handler with various payload types
    
    4. **Set up alerting** for malformed payloads to catch API changes early

## Advanced Troubleshooting

For persistent webhook issues, consider implementing these advanced solutions:

1. **Webhook queue system** to handle high volumes of incoming webhooks
2. **Dead letter queue** for failed webhook processing attempts
3. **Circuit breaker pattern** to prevent cascading failures when dependent services are down
4. **Comprehensive logging and monitoring** to track webhook reliability over time

If you continue experiencing webhook issues after trying these solutions, please contact our support team at [pennie@a1base.com](mailto:pennie@a1base.com) with details about your specific problem.
